# Client-Side Encryption JavaScript Package

## Problem Statement

In today's era of cloud computing and web applications, the transmission of sensitive information over the internet is a common practice. However, this convenience comes with inherent security risks. Data in transit is vulnerable to interception, unauthorized access, and potential breaches. While traditional server-side encryption protects data while it's stored on the server, it leaves data exposed during transmission between the client and the server.

## Aim

The aim of this project is to design and implement a versatile JavaScript package that simplifies client-side encryption for web applications. This package empowers developers to seamlessly encrypt sensitive data before transmitting it over the network to the server.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to enhance data privacy and security by giving users control over their encrypted data during transit. This approach promotes a "zero trust" architecture, where data remains confidential and protected even when in transit between the client and the server.

## Key Features

- **Easy Integration**: The package provides a simple and intuitive API for developers to integrate client-side encryption into their web applications.

- **Strong Encryption**: Utilizes state-of-the-art encryption algorithms to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data.

- **Data Control**: Users retain control over their data throughout the entire transmission process, reducing reliance on server-side security.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across different web platforms and browsers.

- **Scalable**: Designed to accommodate varying levels of data complexity and volume.

- **Community Support**: Encourages collaboration and contributions from the open-source community.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the package, refer to the documentation and examples in the [documentation folder](/docs).

## Installation

You can install the package using npm:

```shell
npm install clisien
```

## Usage

You can use the package this way:
